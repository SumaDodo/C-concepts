**BellmanFord Algorithm**
- The relax operation is to check if there exists a distance to node n such that the current distance is larger, then update the distance to the new distance
- set the parent to the source from which the edge arises


if the graph is a sparse graph then run time complexity of bellmanford algorithm is O(n^2)  
if the graph is really dense then the run time complexity is even more high i.e. O(n^3)
