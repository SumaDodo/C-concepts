**Vectors**
- These are the dynamic arrays that can resize on adding and removing the elements from the vector. 
- The storage is managed automatically by the container.
- Elements of the vector are stored in continuous manner so that the vector can be traversed using iterators.
- The data is inserted at the end.
---
*Time Complexity*
- Insertion takes differential time as at times it is needed to extend the array.
- Deletion of the last element takes constant time.
- insertion or deletion any where else other than the end takes linear time as it has to be traversed.
