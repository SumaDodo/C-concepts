**Programming Concepts**  
> 1. **Heuristics:** Algorithms where you don't have any gaurantee on the quality of the algorithm.
> 2. **Approximation algorithms:** Normally the approximation algorithms are designed for NP-hard and NP-Commplete problems so as to get an efficient algorithm and to get a good bound.
